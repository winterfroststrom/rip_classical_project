run-all-problems-A3: runs a strategy with A3 on all instances of all
domains


run-S11S31R1R3GB3-problems: run strategies on mixture A3/A1 on per
domain-basis as in ICAPS, except that pipesnotanknow also has 3
because S11 can then additionally nr 12 and S13 can then additionally
solve nr 41. instances subset is
union-of(solved-by-S11-A1,solved-by-S11-A3,solved-by-S13-A3) with mem
limit 3GB. this subset was determined using run-all-problems-A3 and
the results from the earlier stragies/ data. note that
solved-by-S13-A1 is currently assumed to be a subset of
solved-by-S11-A1.


... rest is basically as in strategies/
