This is a validator for the translator output that should test all the
relevant details of the output such as:

* Do all referenced propostions exist?
* Are operator preconditions and goals consistent?
* Are variable names in the key file unique?
* Do all effects modify fluent variables exclusively?
* Do all axioms modify derived variables exclusively?
* Do the axioms satisfy the layering condition, both for
  real axioms and for "extended" axioms used by the heuristics?

It can also be used to present a human-readable description of the
translator output that replace the variable/value int pairs with the
corresponding fact names from the proposition file.

The statistics.py script generates some simple statistics for the
output, such as number of variables, number of operators, etc.
